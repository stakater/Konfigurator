## Deploying to Kubernetes

Deploying Konfigurator is a 2 step procedure:

1. Deploy CRD to your cluster
2. Deploy Konfigurator operator

So first apply the CRD manifest by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Konfigurator/master/deploy/crd.yaml
```

Once the CRD is installed, you can deploy the operator on your kubernetes cluster via any of the following methods.

### Vanilla Manifests

You can apply vanilla manifests by running the following command

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakater/Konfigurator/master/deployments/kubernetes/konfigurator.yaml
```

By default Konfigurator gets deployed in the default namespace and manages its custom resources in that namespace.

### Helm Charts

Alternatively if you have configured helm on your cluster, you can add konfigurator to helm from our public chart repository and deploy it via helm using below mentioned commands

```bash
helm repo add stakater https://stakater.github.io/stakater-charts

helm repo update

helm install stakater/konfigurator
```

Once Konfigurator is running, you can start creating resources supported by it. For details about its custom resources, look [here](https://github.com/stakater/Konfigurator/tree/master/docs/konfigurator-template.md).
